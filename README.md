Firstly, huge thanks to /u/lovelybac0n for [a lot of inspiration](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/3mtqv0/i3_finally_it_all_comes_together/) (as in, I basically stole this from them)!

# Programs used
+ i3
+ conky
+ playerctl (for multimedia buttons)
+ amixer (alsa) (for volume buttons and volume in bar)
+ i3lock
+ scrot
+ jsawk (for weather script)

# Notes
+ You'll probably want to edit conky/scripts/weather and update it with the correct city id from [this list](http://openweathermap.org/help/city_list.txt).
+ Now playing in the bar is for Spotify, if you use another player you'll have to edit conky.conf.
